# Overview

This is a program I wrote to learn C#.  I took the concept of calculating interest to do this.
In this program, you can calculate simple interest (car loans, mortgages, etc) and also compound
interest (credit cards, investments).  The compound interest calculator will also display a yearly
amortization table showing how interest acures each year.

After you have .Net installed you can run this application by:
* Building a new application in the console by typing "dotnet new console -0 application name"
* Running "code ." in the folder you named your application
* Entering "donet run"

# Future Work

A list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Adding the ability to compare / contrast two different loans or investments.
- Ability to save the results to a file (probably pdf)
